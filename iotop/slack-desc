# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

iotop: iotop (input/output monitoring tool)
iotop:
iotop: iotop identifies processes that use high amount of input/output requests on
iotop: your machine. It is similar to the well known top utility, but instead of
iotop: showing you what consumes CPU the most, it lists processes by their IO usage.
